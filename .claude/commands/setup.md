  Full one-time project setup in one guided session — git preflight, then /intake (definition +
  stack) → checkpoint commit → /bootstrap (skeleton, proven) → checkpoint commit → /gate (P1
  review) → /wrapup (session recorded). Thin orchestrator: the logic lives in the piece commands;
  this sequences them and manages git.

Run the complete project setup end-to-end. This command is a **sequencer, not a source of truth** —
the same rule `/bootstrap` applies to skills: invoke each piece command below and follow it
**verbatim**; never reimplement, summarize, or shortcut its content. What this command owns is the
ordering and the **git management** between pieces, so setup ends as clean committed history, not a
pile of uncommitted files.

## 0. Git preflight

- `git rev-parse --git-dir` — no repo? Ask, then `git init` and commit the pre-setup state as-is
  (`chore: pre-scaffold state`) so everything setup does is diffable against it.
- `git status` — **pre-existing uncommitted changes are not yours to bundle.** If there are any,
  stop and ask: commit them first (their own commit, their own message), stash, or abort.
- Branch: on a fresh/empty project, work directly on the default branch — there's nothing to
  protect yet. If the repo already carries real code, branch `setup/scaffold` and land it at the
  end per the landing convention `/intake` captures.

## 1. `/intake` — definition + stack

Invoke the `intake` command and follow it verbatim (definition interview → stack interview →
`skillOverrides` → placeholders → its report).

**Checkpoint commit** when it completes: the config + definition artifacts
(`.claude/settings.json`, filled skills, `memory/process/*`), message like
`chore: configure scaffold (/intake)`. Use the commit trailer `/intake` just captured, if any —
this commit is the first one it applies to.

## 2. `/bootstrap` — skeleton, proven

Invoke the `bootstrap` command and follow it verbatim — including its "prove it runs" step in
full (real train/eval/resume on synthetic data).

**Checkpoint commit** only after that verification actually passed: the skeleton + tests,
`feat: bootstrap project skeleton (/bootstrap)`. A skeleton whose smoke didn't pass does not get
committed — fix or report, don't checkpoint broken.

## 3. `/gate` — the P1 review

Invoke the `gate` command for P1. The definition doc from step 1 is most of T1's evidence, so this
should be quick — but run it honestly; open questions recorded during the definition stay
unchecked and become gate debt, which is fine and correct. Commit the phase-state/memory updates:
`chore: record P1 gate review (/gate)`.

## 4. Land + `/wrapup` + report

If step 0 used a `setup/scaffold` branch, land it per the captured convention (merge to main
locally, or push + PR).

Then invoke the `wrapup` command verbatim to close the session out: the session note records what
setup built, the checkpoint commits + branch, and the current phase + gate debt (its instructions
already cover this); the roadmap gets the open items. Skip wrapup's own commit/land step — this
command's checkpoints already did it; just record the hashes in the note per the memory skill.

Finally, report — deferring to each piece's own report for its detail:

- **Commits:** each checkpoint with its hash; branch + landing status.
- **Verdicts:** the P1 gate result (passed / debt items).
- **Recorded:** the session note path from `/wrapup`.
- **Still open:** the human-decision placeholders and gate debt, in one consolidated list.

One-time: re-runs happen at the **piece** level (`/intake` to change stacks, `/bootstrap` to
reshape, `/gate` any time) — not by re-running this command.
