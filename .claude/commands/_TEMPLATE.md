disable-model-invocation: true   # template placeholder — remove this line in your real command unless it's user-run-only

<The prompt that runs when the user types /this-command. Write it as direct instructions to Claude.>

<!--
Notes:
- The filename is the command name: commands/deploy.md → /deploy.
- $ARGUMENTS expands to everything typed after the command; $1, $2, … are positional args.
  Example: "Fetch issue #$1 and implement a fix."
- Prefix a line with ! to run a bash command and inline its output (needs allowed-tools: Bash).
  Example: "Current diff:\n!`git diff`"
- Reference a file's contents with @path/to/file.
- Keep commands task-shaped and deterministic — they're for repeatable workflows.
