description: One-time onboarding — interview the user for their stack, write skillOverrides, and fill the answerable <PLACEHOLDER>s.
---

Onboard this scaffold to the user's actual stack. This is a **one-time** run: interview, flip the
tool-skill profile, resolve the placeholders the answers determine, then report. Work through the
steps in order; don't skip ahead.

## 1. Interview (use the **AskUserQuestion** tool)

Ask these — one question each, with the defaults marked. Batch them into a single AskUserQuestion call
where the tool allows:

- **Experiment tracker** — MLflow *(default)* / Weights & Biases / none.
- **Config system** — Hydra *(default)* / plain OmegaConf / argparse.
- **Data versioning** — DVC *(default)* / git-lfs / none.
- **Baseline confirm** — the scaffold assumes **uv** for envs and an **NVIDIA GPU** (local or over SSH).
  Confirm that holds, and ask whether the GPU box is **aarch64/ARM** (e.g. a Grace-Blackwell / DGX Spark)
  — because ARM needs the ARM torch index placeholder filled in `env-uv`.

Capture the four answers before touching any file.

## 2. Write `settings.json` `skillOverrides`

Edit `.claude/settings.json` — set each key to `"on"` or `"off"` from the answers. Only these keys:

| Key | On when… |
|---|---|
| `env-uv` | always `on` (baseline) |
| `tracking-mlflow` | tracker = MLflow |
| `tracking-wandb` | tracker = W&B |
| `config-hydra` | config = Hydra |
| `config-omegaconf` | config = plain OmegaConf |
| `data-dvc` | data versioning = DVC |

Exactly one tracker key and one config key should be `on`; the unchosen siblings go `off`. If the tracker
or data-versioning answer is "none", leave all keys in that group `off`. **Note:** `tracking-wandb` and
`config-omegaconf` skills may not be authored yet — writing their override is a harmless no-op until they
exist (fast-follow), so set them anyway.

## 3. Fill the answerable `<PLACEHOLDER>`s

Run `grep -rn "<PLACEHOLDER" .claude/ CLAUDE.md README.md` to list every one. Resolve **only** those the
interview now answers; leave the rest for the user. The answer-determined ones:

- **MLflow tracking URI** — `.claude/skills/tracking-mlflow/SKILL.md` (`set_tracking_uri(...)`). Fill if
  the user gave a URI; otherwise leave and flag it. Skip entirely if the tracker isn't MLflow.
- **DVC remote URL** — `.claude/skills/data-dvc/SKILL.md` (`dvc remote add -d storage ...`). Fill with the
  user's remote if given; else flag. Skip if data versioning isn't DVC.
- **ARM torch index** — `.claude/skills/env-uv/SKILL.md` (`<PLACEHOLDER: ARM torch index for your box>`).
  Fill **only if** the box is aarch64/ARM; on x86 leave the surrounding note as-is and note it's N/A.
- **Dataset path placeholders** — e.g. `data/<PLACEHOLDER: dataset dir>` / `<PLACEHOLDER: dataset_name>`
  in `data-dvc` and `datasets`. Fill if the user named a dataset/path during intake; otherwise leave.

Don't invent values. If an answer wasn't given, leave the placeholder and list it in the summary.
Placeholders unrelated to these four questions (testing commands, governance domains, architecture doc,
seed helper, etc.) are out of scope — leave them for the user.

## 4. Report

Print a short summary:

- **Skills on:** the `skillOverrides` keys now `on`. **Skills off:** the rest.
- **Placeholders filled:** file + what each became.
- **Still needs you:** every `<PLACEHOLDER` left unresolved (from the step-3 grep), so the user knows the
  manual follow-ups.

Then remind the user this command is one-time — re-run it only to change stacks.
