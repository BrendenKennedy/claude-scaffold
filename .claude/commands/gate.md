Run a phase-gate review per `PROCESS.md` §3.8. The gate is a checklist filled with **evidence, not
assent** — a file path, a number, a link, a table row. "Yeah we did that" does not check a box.

1. **Load state.** Read `@PROCESS.md` (the phase definitions + exit gates) and
   `@.claude/memory/process/phase-state.md` (the current phase + gate history). The phase under
   review is `$1` if given, otherwise the current phase in the phase-state file. If the phase-state
   file says the project hasn't started, the review target is P1.

2. **Walk the checklist.** For each item in that phase's exit gate in PROCESS.md:
   - Ask the user for (or locate in the repo yourself) the **evidence** — then record the item in
     the phase-state file as `[x]` with a one-line evidence pointer.
   - A conditional item (e.g., P2's labeling items) may be recorded `N/A` **with a written reason**.
   - No evidence → it stays `[ ]` with one line on exactly what's missing.
   Don't soften: an item that's "mostly done" is unchecked.

3. **Review the risk register.** Read `@.claude/memory/process/risk-register.md`. With the user:
   are the listed risks still live, are mitigations current, did this phase surface new risks?
   Update the table.

4. **Verdict — and this is the part that must not bend:**
   - **All items `[x]` or `N/A`-with-reason** → record **PASS** (date + reviewer) in the phase-state
     file's gate history, advance **Current phase** to the next phase, and clear any gate debt for
     the passed phase.
   - **Any item unchecked** → record **BLOCKED** in the gate history and list the unchecked items
     under **Gate debt**. Do **not** advance the phase, and do not offer to "advance anyway" — the
     override path is the user editing the phase-state file themselves, deliberately.

5. **Record decisions.** Any judgment call made during the review (a threshold chosen, a risk
   accepted, a scope cut) goes through the `governance` skill's decision-log protocol — one line,
   append-only.

Report the verdict, the evidence table, and (if blocked) the shortest path to clearing each debt item.
