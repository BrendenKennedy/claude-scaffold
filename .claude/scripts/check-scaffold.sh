# check-scaffold.sh — the scaffold's self-consistency check. Run locally or from CI.
#
# A scaffold's product is internal consistency: the map (CLAUDE.md, README.md) must match the
# territory (.claude/). Both real bugs in this repo's history were drift of exactly that kind —
# a .gitignore that silently swallowed the datasets skill, and a README that missed /bootstrap
# and the pipelines skill. This script makes that class of bug fail loudly.
#
# Checks:
#   1. DRIFT      — every real skill / command / agent on disk is named in CLAUDE.md AND README.md
#   2. FRONTMATTER — every SKILL.md / agent has name: + description:; SKILL.md name matches its dir
#   2b. VALIDITY  — every frontmatter block parses as real YAML (the bug class that bit twice),
#                   descriptions fit the 1,536-char listing truncation cap, and one-time
#                   commands/templates carry disable-model-invocation: true
#   3. CONFIG     — settings.json parses; every hook it wires exists, is executable, and compiles;
#                   every skillOverride set "on" has a skill directory backing it
#   4. INSTALL    — install.sh into a temp dir lands every file, re-run adds nothing (idempotent),
#                   and the <PLACEHOLDER> count survives the trip
#   5. OWNERSHIP  — every file carrying a <PLACEHOLDER> is claimed by /intake or /bootstrap (named
#                   in their fill lists) — an unclaimed placeholder is a blank nobody will ever fill
