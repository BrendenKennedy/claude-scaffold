# Roadmap

The living backlog: future scope, open threads, and TODOs. Sessions point their follow-ups here;
recall reads here for "what's next". Keep it pruned — check off or delete finished items.
Doubles as the scope **parking lot** (PROCESS.md §3.3): promotion into the v1 contract needs the
written gate + a decision-log line.

## Now / in progress
- Skill coverage, remaining: monitoring/observability skill (deferred until first deploy — P7
  covers concepts), tabular/classical-DS workflow skill (add if the archetype gets used),
  `llm-eval` companion to `finetune-unsloth`, HPO (Optuna) tool skill

## Next
- Release v0.4.0: VERSION + CHANGELOG for the process framework + efficiency pass
- Run `/doctor` to confirm the skill-listing budget post-rewrite
- Watch skill surfacing after the description rewrite; sharpen under-triggering descriptions

## Someday / maybe
- Multi-archetype `/bootstrap` skeletons (agent builds, tabular) — hook point exists in `/intake` step 0 lane-fit
- `config-omegaconf` skill (fast-follow noted in `/intake`)
- Stop-hook gate-debt warning (stricter §3.8 enforcement)

## Done (recent)
- `finetune-unsloth` (tool-gated) + MLflow Model Registry section + version pins on all tool
  skills + `/skill-update` — 2026-07-18
- Process framework integration + context-efficiency pass — 2026-07-18,
  [session note](sessions/2026-07-18-process-and-efficiency.md), commit `436a1f6`
