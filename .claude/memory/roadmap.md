# Roadmap

The living backlog: future scope, open threads, and TODOs. Sessions point their follow-ups here;
recall reads here for "what's next". Keep it pruned — check off or delete finished items.
Doubles as the scope **parking lot** (PROCESS.md §3.3): promotion into the v1 contract needs the
written gate + a decision-log line.

## Now / in progress
- (nothing active — the next real project run through `/setup` drives the backlog)

## Next
- Run `/doctor` to confirm the skill-listing budget post-rewrite
- Watch skill surfacing after the description rewrite; sharpen under-triggering descriptions

## Someday / maybe
- Multi-archetype `/bootstrap` skeletons (tabular/timeseries/LLM entry points — the skills now exist; the skeleton is still Hydra+CV-shaped)
- Causal inference skill (observational methods beyond A/B — DoWhy/propensity) — when demand shows
- Big-data escalation skills (polars/duckdb/spark) — when demand shows
- Kubernetes manager, SageMaker/EC2 surface for `infra-aws`, GCP/Azure lanes — parked on demand (AWS S3+Redshift + Docker/Compose shipped in v0.8.0)
- Data-validation tool skill (pandera/great-expectations)
- Stop-hook gate-debt warning (stricter §3.8 enforcement)
