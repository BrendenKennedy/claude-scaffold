  AWS for DS infrastructure — S3 + Redshift via the AWS CLI and boto3, acting through a
  least-privilege `claude-for-datascience` IAM role (starter policy:
  `.claude/templates/aws-iam-policy.json`). Carries: the role model (project-prefixed resource
  ARNs, read-heavy defaults, explicit denies on bucket/cluster deletion and all IAM mutation),
  credential hygiene (named profiles / SSO — keys never in the repo or transcript), S3 data
  plumbing (buckets as DVC remotes, `aws s3 sync`, versioning + lifecycle for raw immutability),
  Redshift access (UNLOAD/COPY through S3, the Data API; query discipline stays in `sql`), cost
  awareness (know what a command spends before running it), and the first-time setup walkthrough
  (CLI install without sudo, SSO-vs-keys auth done on the human's side, creating the identity +
  attaching the policy, verifying the boundary). Load when provisioning or touching AWS — or
  when `aws` isn't installed yet. Triggers: AWS, S3, bucket, boto3, aws cli, IAM, role,
  Redshift, UNLOAD, COPY, s3 sync, presigned URL, cloud storage, DVC remote s3, aws profile,

# infra-aws — AWS through a role that can't hurt you much

**Pinned:** awscli, boto3 — unpinned · authored 2026-07-18 · run `/skill-update infra-aws` once
the deps are installed (`uv add boto3`; the CLI installs system-side)

> On-demand: load this when the project's infrastructure is AWS. The **boundary is the IAM
> policy, not this skill's judgment** — same philosophy as the repo's security model (hooks are
> guardrails; permissions are the boundary), extended to the cloud. Scope v1: **S3 + Redshift**.
> SageMaker/EC2 are deliberately out until demand shows. Credential *policy* lives in the
> security canon (`governance` → `security.md`); warehouse query discipline is `sql`.

## The role model — set up once, by the human
Claude acts through a dedicated **`claude-for-datascience`** IAM identity whose policy is the
blast radius. Starter policy: `.claude/templates/aws-iam-policy.json` — copy it, replace
`PROJECT-PREFIX` (S3 bucket prefix), `ACCOUNT-ID`, `REGION`, `CLUSTER-NAME`, `DB-NAME`, and `DB-USER`, review it
yourself, then attach it. Its shape, which the human should verify survives their edits:
- **Project-prefixed ARNs only** — `arn:aws:s3:::PROJECT-PREFIX-*`; the role cannot see other
  buckets' contents.
- **Explicit `Deny` on the catastrophic tier** — `s3:DeleteBucket`, `redshift:DeleteCluster`,
  and **all `iam:*`** (the role must never be able to widen itself). Deny beats any Allow,
  including ones added later by mistake.
- Turn **CloudTrail on** for the account and enable **S3 versioning** on project buckets —
  auditability and undo are part of least privilege.
- Prefer an assumable **role** (SSO / `aws configure sso`) over long-lived user keys; either
  way the credentials live in `~/.aws/` or the environment — **never** in the repo, `.env`
  included (`.env` holds app config; AWS credentials have their own store).

Sanity check before any work: `aws sts get-caller-identity` — confirm you are the scoped role,
not someone's admin profile.

**Every bucket/cluster provisioned gets a row in the resource matrix**
(`.claude/memory/process/resources.md`) + its env keys in `.env.example`, same commit — the
matrix is how the rest of the stack knows where everything is accessed and where each
credential lives (by reference).

## First-time setup — the walkthrough (agent and human each have a part)
Run this top to bottom when AWS work starts on a fresh box. Steps are split deliberately:
the agent does the mechanical parts; the human does everything that touches admin power or a
secret.

**1. CLI present?** `command -v aws || aws --version`. If missing, two install paths:
- **Agent-runnable, no sudo:** download the official v2 bundle and install user-local —
  `curl -o /tmp/awscliv2.zip "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip"`,
  `unzip`, then `./aws/install -i ~/.local/aws-cli -b ~/.local/bin` (ensure `~/.local/bin` is
  on PATH). Never pipe the download into a shell (the bash hook blocks it anyway); the
  system-wide install needs sudo, which this agent deliberately cannot run — that variant is
  the human's, via the `!` prefix in their prompt.
- `uv add boto3` for the Python side (per `env-uv`; it shares the CLI's credential chain).

**2. Authenticate — on the human's side, always.** Access keys and SSO logins must never pass
through the chat (a pasted secret lives in the transcript forever — security canon). Ask the
user to run, in their own terminal or via the `!` prefix:
- **Preferred:** `aws configure sso` (short-lived credentials; needs the org's SSO start URL),
  then `aws sso login --profile <profile>` when sessions expire.
- **Fallback:** `aws configure --profile claude-ds` with an access key **they** created for the
  scoped identity (console → IAM → the user → security credentials). The agent's job is to say
  *which identity* the key must belong to — never to receive the key.
Set the project to the profile via config/env (`AWS_PROFILE=claude-ds` in `.env` is fine —
it's a *name*, not a secret).

**3. Create the identity + attach the policy — human, with their admin profile.** The agent
prepares; the human executes (the agent's own role has `iam:*` denied, and the hook asks on
any `aws iam` mutation — both by design). Prepare for them: the filled-in policy JSON (from
the template, placeholders replaced), and this sequence —
```bash
aws iam create-policy --policy-name claude-for-datascience \
    --policy-document file://aws-iam-policy.filled.json
aws iam create-user --user-name claude-for-datascience        # or create-role + trust policy for SSO/assume
aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name claude-for-datascience \
    --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT-ID:policy/claude-for-datascience
```
Console clicking works identically (IAM → Policies → Create from JSON → attach). Either way,
**the human reads the policy before attaching** — the review is the point, not a formality.

**4. Verify the boundary, both directions.** As the new profile:
`aws sts get-caller-identity` (the scoped identity, not admin) ·
`aws s3 ls s3://PROJECT-PREFIX-data` (allowed path works) · and one **expected failure**, e.g.
`aws iam list-users` — it must be denied. A boundary you never saw refuse anything is a
boundary you haven't tested.

## S3 — the project's durable data layer
- **Bucket convention:** `PROJECT-PREFIX-data` (raw + processed, versioned, lifecycle to IA/
  Glacier for old raw), `PROJECT-PREFIX-artifacts` (checkpoints, exports — the DVC remote).
- **DVC remote:** `dvc remote add -d storage s3://PROJECT-PREFIX-artifacts/dvc` — then the
  existing `data-dvc` flow (push/pull, pin-to-commit) works unchanged; boto3/awscli creds are
  picked up automatically.
- **Moving data:** `aws s3 sync` (idempotent, resumable) over `cp` for trees; `--dryrun` first
  when the direction is `local → bucket` onto existing keys. Presigned URLs
  (`aws s3 presign`, expiry short) to hand a file to someone — never make a bucket public.
- **Raw immutability in the cloud:** versioning on + a lifecycle rule, and the deny on
  `DeleteBucket`; recursive `aws s3 rm` is confirm-gated by the bash hook.

## Redshift — the warehouse door (the queries themselves are `sql`)
- **Access:** the Data API (`aws redshift-data execute-statement` / boto3
  `redshift-data`) — no long-lived connections or passwords in code; auth rides the IAM role.
- **Bulk in/out goes through S3, always:** `UNLOAD ('SELECT ...') TO 's3://PROJECT-PREFIX-...'`
  for extracts (then the snapshot-what-training-eats rule from `sql` applies to the landed
  files), `COPY` from S3 for loads. Row-by-row inserts and `SELECT *` over the wire are the
  anti-pattern at warehouse scale.
- Training extracts landed from UNLOAD get versioned (`data-dvc`) and recorded in the dataset
  manifest with the query file + extract time.

## Cost awareness (cost bugs are silent like leakage bugs)
Know the pricing dimension before running: S3 = storage + requests + **egress** (a `sync` down
of a TB is a bill), Redshift = cluster-hours (or RPU-hours serverless) — don't leave clusters
running for a weekly query; lifecycle rules are the cheapest habit. Anything projected to cost
real money is a decision for the user, stated in dollars, before the command — and new
recurring costs get a decision-log line.

## Gotchas
- **Region mismatch** is the classic silent failure — bucket and cluster region pinned in
  config (`${oc.env:AWS_REGION}` via the config system), not defaulted per-shell.
- The hook confirm-gates `aws s3 rb`, recursive `s3 rm`, `redshift delete-*`, and any
  `aws iam` mutation — if the dialog surprises you, stop and re-read what you were about to do.
- boto3 pagination: list operations truncate at 1,000 — use paginators, or counts lie.
