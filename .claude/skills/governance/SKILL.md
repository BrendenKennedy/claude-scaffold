  Which policy governs a change and how to apply it — the index + locate→load→apply→record protocol
  over the policy canon in `.claude/memory/policy/`. Load for any governed change:
  secrets/credentials/egress (security), dataset licensing/PII/labels (data-governance), model
  reproducibility/checkpoints/release (model-governance), phase gates/scope/kill-pivot (process →
  `PROCESS.md`). Records judgment calls in per-domain decision logs; new domains register by
  authoring canon + adding an index row. Triggers: policy, governance, is this allowed, compliance,
  decision log, ADR, record a decision, secret, credential, API key, token, .env, PII, data egress,
  is this safe to log/send, threat model, prompt injection, supply chain, torch.load weights_only,
  license, model card, phase gate, kill criteria, scope promotion. Policy text lives only in the
  canon files — this skill indexes and never restates.

# Governance — the index + access protocol over this repo's policy

> On-demand: load this for any governed change — locating the right policy, applying it, recording a
> decision, or adding a policy domain. It's the map + protocol; the authored policy text lives in
> `.claude/memory/policy/` (below) and wins on any conflict. Run the loop directly whenever you touch a
> governed domain — no agent required.

## The governance model (two layers, one source of truth)
- **Canon** — the authored policy, a version-controlled file at `.claude/memory/policy/<domain>.md`. The
  source of truth. A human reads it; code is written and data is shaped from it.
- **This skill** — the index across domains + the access protocol + (folded-in) each domain's sharp
  triggers, so a governed change auto-surfaces governance and routes to the right canon. It never restates
  policy.

Policy text lives in exactly one place — the canon file — never copied into a skill or duplicated
elsewhere.

## Policy index (the domains + where their canon lives)
> Ships with the authored domains below. Add a row per new governed domain (e.g. a `code-conventions.md`
> once your Python idioms stabilize); each row's canon file goes in `.claude/memory/policy/`.

| Domain | Governs | Canon (`.claude/memory/policy/`) | Decision log | Apply when… |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `data-governance` | datasets, labels, licensing, PII/sensitive imagery, splits & leakage | `data-governance.md` | `data-governance-decision-log.md` | ingesting/splitting/labeling data, or adding a dataset |
| `model-governance` | trained-model reproducibility, checkpoint provenance, model cards, release + weight licensing | `model-governance.md` | `model-governance-decision-log.md` | training, checkpointing, or releasing a model |
| `security` | secrets & credentials, what may be logged/egressed, supply chain, the guardrails-vs-boundary threat model | `security.md` | `security-decision-log.md` | touching anything that holds or moves a credential, adding logging/tracking calls, or sending data anywhere external |
| `process` | the project lifecycle — phases, exit gates, scope, risks, kill/pivot | **`PROCESS.md` (repo root** — travels with the project, so its canon lives there, not in `policy/`; live state in `.claude/memory/process/`, run via the `process` skill + `/gate`**)** | `.claude/memory/process/decision-log.md` | starting/advancing/closing a phase, changing scope, or making a kill/pivot call |
| `<code-conventions>` | how any source module is written — the repeated Python idioms | `<code-conventions.md>` | — | writing or editing any source file (add this canon when your idioms settle) |

_Add a row per new domain. If a domain produces a generated artifact (a spec the code implements), note
that it's data, not policy, and lives outside `policy/`. Decision logs are append-only and created on the
first judgment call — they won't exist until then._

## Access protocol — locate → load → apply → record
1. **Locate.** Match the change to a domain above (several can apply to one change). No matching domain
   ⇒ no policy yet; proceed or propose one.
2. **Load.** Read that domain's **canon** file in `.claude/memory/policy/`. Canon wins on conflict.
3. **Apply.** Follow the canon — copy the idioms, run the decision procedure, or check the invariants +
   checklist for that domain.
4. **Record.** If the domain has a **decision log**, log every irreducible judgment call there
   (append-only: what / which rule / why). Prescriptive domains (a fixed style guide) have no log.

## Add a policy domain (the extension protocol)
1. **Author the canon** at `.claude/memory/policy/<name>.md` — the authored source of truth.
2. **Register a row** in the Policy index above, and fold that domain's sharp triggers into this skill's
   `description` so governed changes auto-surface it.
3. If the domain makes judgment calls over time, add a **decision log** beside its canon.

Keep policy in ONE skill — this one; don't spawn a skill per policy domain. One index, many canon files.

## Who runs this
Any session or specialist that touches a governed domain runs the locate→load→apply→record loop directly —
the decentralized model: each specialist agent gets a one-line pointer to this skill for the policy on what
it edits. There is deliberately **no governance-manager agent** (policy is applied where the work happens,
not by a coordinator).

## Gotcha
This skill only **indexes and explains access** — it is deliberately thin. If you find yourself restating
idioms, rules, or checklists here, stop: that belongs in the canon file (single source of truth). Policy
canon lives in `.claude/memory/policy/`; this skill points at it and never copies it.
